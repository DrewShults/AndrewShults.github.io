intro: |
  I am an engineer with 4.5 years experience working in technology. I have primarily worked in SQL, but have worked across a broad range of technologies thereon: C#, Javascript, ASP.Net MVC, Azure DevOps, Salesforce, VB.Net. As well as spending a reasonable amount of time building applications for the web, which has given me an exposure to a range of javascript technologies over the years, through jQuery, extjs, knockout, backbone and most recently to React. <br/><br/>
  I enjoy building interesting products, with a good Product Management focus and a good emphasis on good engineering principles and clean code.<br/><br/>
